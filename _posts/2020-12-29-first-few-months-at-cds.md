I've now been with the (Colorado Digital Service)[https://sites.google.com/state.co.us/coloradodigitalservice/home] for two months (started in October), and I'm beginning to get the hang of things. This is my first job in my career working in the public sector, and it's sure a change of pace! 

The Colorado Digital Service is modeled after the (US Digital Service)[https://www.usds.gov/], which was created after the HealthCare.gov rollout struggles. The goal of the USDS is to "Recruit top designers, engineers, product managers, and digital policy experts. Pair these digital experts with our nationâ€™s leading civil servants. Deploy these teams to untangle the most important government services, together."  The idea is that tech talent from the private sector would do a 6 month - 2 year "tour of service" to build great digital service teams inside government. One of the team members here likens it to riding a tandem bicycle. Don't tell people about riding a bicycle, show them by pairing up. (Matt Cutts gives a great TED Talk[https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_what_happens_when_a_silicon_valley_technologist_works_for_the_government] about what it's like to work at the Digital Service that I highly recommend.

During my tour at CDS, I will be focusing on Colorado's Child Welfare project (internally called "Trails"). It's a tool that's currently in a "modernization" transition - from a ~15 year old PowerBuilder/Oracle application to an ASP.NET website. There have been some struggles along the way and we've missed some deadlines. My goals are to guide the transition to completion, and build a team to carry on the work for the forseeable future.

Oh, and (we are hiring)[https://sites.google.com/state.co.us/coloradodigitalservice/were-hiring]! Please join us to build better government!
