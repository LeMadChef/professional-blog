I've been meaning to write about my tour at the [Colorado Digital Service](https://colorado.gov/digitalservice) for some time, and have been putting it off for far too long. It's time to start talking about things I've learned, and what it's like to work in state government. I'm going to leave specifics out and focus more on the leadership and technology. 

Work in progress list:
* Reducing unplanned downtime
* Doing more with less
* Knowlege transition
* The costs of "Maintenance Mode"
* Inheriting code from a vendor
* How to modernize legacy systems
* Hiring
* Building code to last 50 years (!!)
