title: Government Bureaucracy?
---

Something I've noticed is that the amount of bureaucracy is actually very close to what I've experienced working in the private sector (at companies larger than ~100 people). People often say "government is inefficient" but I'm assuming those folks have never worked at a Fortune 500, because there's a lot of inefficiency in large companies as well.
